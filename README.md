These files contain the code and data necessary to replicate the results from Del Negro, Hasegawa, and Schorfheide ([2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304407616300094#:~:text=This%20dynamic%20linear%20prediction%20pool,to%20lie%20on%20a%20simplex.&text=These%20pools%20are%20optimal%20in,the%20pool's%20historic%20forecast%20performance)). We provide the data used to produce the results of the original paper as well as the corrected data used to produce the results contained in the [corrigendum)().
